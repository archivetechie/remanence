# Tape I/O read pipeline (TIO-6) — read submitter, read reservoir (watermark stop-start), relay unblocking — Design v0.4

**Status:** **FROZEN v0.4** (2026-07-11) — IN_BAND regime removed (owner);
single-regime reservoir stop-start. **Final codex verify (gpt-5.6-sol) 2026-07-11
11:41 — PASS, no blockers/majors; design FREEZES.** 2 doc/spec MINORS to fold at
prompt-cut: (1) `reference-configuration.md` add the 4 reservoir/proof keys
(`read_reservoir_bytes`, both watermark %, `position_check_bytes_ranged`) + rewrite
the spool row so post-R2 authority is the shared ceiling not a `MemAvailable` clamp;
(2) §3.2 — size free/delivery channels at window-creation for the effective max slab
count (bounded channels don't grow), assert `allocated ≤ capacity`.
**Fold record:** panel 2026-07-11: 37 findings (14 failure / 9 concurrency /
7 scsi / 7 cost); folded + owner decisions. The dominant convergence (3 lenses)
was the wrap-don't-copy contradiction — resolved in §3.3/§3.6/§5. The single
largest v0.1→v0.2 change is an **owner reversal**: v0.1 §4 "reads accept
shoe-shine" is REJECTED; anti-shoe-shine is now core, designed in §4 as a
watermark-controlled host-RAM read reservoir. verify 2026-07-11: 8 majors +
2 minors; folded → v0.3 — proof-frontier delivery protocol (§3.2/§5.5),
priority terminal accumulator + finalization barrier (§5.6), concrete
keepalive (§4.5), fixed-ceiling atomic RAM reservation (§4.6), corrected
wear arithmetic + derived 8 GiB default (§4.1/§4.8), enumerated write-side
helper scope (§4.4/§5), `submitter_remaining` rename,
`T_REPROOF_INCIDENTAL` as a named constant.
owner 2026-07-11: IN_BAND regime REMOVED (over-engineering); single-regime
reservoir stop-start; re-verify gaps closed → v0.4.
**Naming:** settled — **TIO-6** (commits on main already use it; v0.1 Q5 closed).
**Problem source:** the 2026-07-07b MSL3040 window measured field restore at
**13.28 MB/s** end-to-end (undecomposable at the time — read diag was missing),
while a different read path had done 82 MB/s on the same class of object and
the kernel `st` driver via `dd` sustained **246–293 MB/s on the same drive,
HBA, and cartridge**. TIO-5a/5b then landed the write hot-submitter and the
read-side SAFETY machinery (typed `valid_bytes` handoff, staged-CDB cancel,
fixed-ILI cursor invalidation, reset-UA parity, read diag decomposition).
**R1 — the relay fix — has since LANDED (main@5740f1a)**: the 10 ms
sleep-quantized retry is gone (watchdog-bounded `send_with_timeout`), default
chunk is 256 KiB, the sender channel is sized by a 4 MiB byte budget, and
explicit 4 MiB h2 stream/connection windows are set. What remains is R2: reads
are still **synchronous batched-refill-on-exhaustion** — the drive is idle
while the host parses/hashes/relays, and the host is idle while the drive
reads. This design is the throughput-and-wear half: the read submitter plus
the read reservoir, targeting **300 MB/s** restore (owner decision, §11).
**Related:** `design-tape-io-pipelined-submission-v0.1.md` (frozen v0.7 — §3
is the template this mirrors, §5 is this design's charter, §6 the invariant
set), `report-st-harvest-2026-07-10.md` (F1/F2/F4 read semantics already
folded into TIO-5b; C4/O10 = why rem deliberately does NOT copy st's

## 1. The gap, decomposed

### 1.1 What the read path does today (main @ 5740f1a — post-R1)

One restore currently runs this chain, **all serialized on the drive-actor
thread** except the final hop:

```
drive-actor thread                              relay thread
──────────────────                              ─────────────
SG_IO READ (1 MiB, 4×256 KiB records)   ─┐
decode outcome (read_block_batch funnel) │  all serial,
copy each 256 KiB record out of the ring │  drive idle from
tar/PAX format parse                     │  ioctl return to
SHA-256 over payload bytes               │  next submit
StagedReadWriter: to_vec + send ─────────┴─►  recv (sync_channel depth 2)
     (blocks when relay is behind)            ChannelWriter: chunk to 256 KiB
                                              watchdog send_with_timeout
                                              (R1: no sleep loop; byte-budget
                                               channel; 4 MiB h2 windows)
                                              tonic/h2 → client
```

Concretely (`crates/remanence-api/src/read_core.rs`,
`crates/remanence-api/src/write_owner.rs::stream_one_object` /
`stream_with_staged_read_sender_diagnostics`):

- `BatchingBlockSource::refill` issues the next batched READ **only when the
  previous buffer is exhausted** — synchronous ping-pong. The TIO-5b ring
  (`free_buffers`) exists for buffer *reuse*, not read-ahead; exactly one
  buffer is ever being filled or drained at a time.
- Between consecutive SG_IOs the actor thread does the format parse, the
  SHA-256 (`CapturePayloadSink` hashes every payload byte), one full-record
  memcpy per record, one `to_vec` per format-emitted slice, and a send into a
  **depth-2 rendezvous channel** that blocks whenever the relay is behind.
  The write path's disease — host work serialized between ioctls (TIO-5 §1)
  — plus: the *network's* backpressure still propagates directly into the
  SCSI submission gap (R1 made the relay fast and honest, not decoupled).
- ~~The relay thread's 10 ms sleep-quantized `try_send` retry~~ — **fixed by
  R1** (main@5740f1a): watchdog-bounded blocking send preserving the
  per-chunk deadline semantics, 256 KiB default chunks, channel sized by a
  4 MiB byte budget, explicit 4 MiB h2 stream+connection windows,
  `sender_stall_ms` in restore diag. Field confirmation = leg 0 (§10).

### 1.2 Why this is the wrong shape for a tape drive

Reads and writes are symmetric at the drive: the drive fills its internal
buffer from tape autonomously (read-ahead is the drive's job; LTO drives
stream ahead of host demand within their buffer), and the host's only
obligation is to **drain at an average rate ≥ the drive's minimum streaming
rate**. Every millisecond of host-side work between ioctls subtracts from
drain rate exactly as it subtracted from feed rate on the write path. The
morning dd battery proved the platform: synchronous 1 MiB reads through the
same E208e sustain 246–293 MB/s when the submission gap is ~0.1 ms (st's
buffered path). rem's read gap today is not ~0.1 ms; it is
parse+hash+copy+relay-blocking — unbounded, because the gRPC consumer sits
inside it.

**Model caveat, stated up front (panel):** the write→read cadence symmetry
(§2-A, §3.1, §7) is an *assumption*, not a measurement. On reads the drive
must stream AHEAD of host demand; a host stall drains the drive's buffer, and
the next READ then waits on **tape**, not on microseconds. Read ioctl cadence
has never been measured physically on this hardware — it is the single
biggest uncertainty in the §7 model, and leg 0/1 measures it before any
number in §7 is treated as a promise.

### 1.3 Three distinct problems — do not conflate them

1. **The submission gap** (R2 core): host work between ioctls. Fixed by the
   read submitter (§3), the mirror of TIO-5 §3.
2. **The relay pathology** (§6): 13.28 vs 82 MB/s was a ~6× gap that no
   submission-gap model explains. H1 (the 10 ms sleep quantum) was the prime
   suspect; **R1 landed the fix**; leg 0 confirms in the field.
3. **Drive wear under slow consumers** (§4, NEW as a first-class problem):
   any consumer whose sustained rate is below the drive's lowest
   speed-matching band forces stop/reposition cycles (shoe-shine). v0.1
   accepted this; the owner rejected that. The read reservoir (§4) is the
   mechanism that converts continuous backhitching into a small number of
   clean park/resume cycles.

The 82 MB/s July figure is itself consistent with sync ping-pong (§7.1);
the 13.28 figure was the relay pathology stacked on top of it.

## 2. Approaches considered

**A — Hot read submitter on the drive actor, strictly one command in
flight, reservoir handoff to a decoupled consumer (ADOPTED).** Feed-rate
arithmetic transfers from the write side *as a model* (see §1.2 caveat):
ioctl ≈ 0.85–1 ms for 1 MiB when the drive buffer has data; inter-command gap
≤ 0.3 ms ⇒ drain capacity ~740 MB/s ⇒ drive-limited (~300 MB/s HH LTO-9) with
2.5× headroom — **if** read cadence matches write cadence, which leg 0/1
verifies. No command overlap needed, ever. st itself is this shape on reads
(one outstanding command; its read-ahead is host-side buffering, `st.c` C4).

**B — Async sg / queue-depth-2 READs (REJECTED).** Same non-cancellable
in-flight hazard as TIO-5 §2-B, and on the read side it is *worse*: a queued
READ dispatched past a FILEMARK/ILI outcome physically crosses a tape-file
boundary or consumes a mismatched record before the host has decoded the
prior outcome — precisely what TIO-5b's staged-CDB-cancel exists to prevent.
Buys ≤1 ms/command that approach A does not need.

**C — st-style kernel-buffer + backspace read-ahead (REJECTED, standing
decision).** st reads ahead speculatively and *backspaces* over unread
records or accidentally crossed filemarks (`st.c` C4/O10). rem's plan-bounded
read-ahead (§3.1) never reads a record the restore plan does not already
name, so there is nothing to backspace over. The st harvest already
documented-discarded this structure; this design re-affirms it. Note the
reservoir (§4) is NOT this: it buffers records the plan names, downstream of
the funnel, with zero speculative motion.

**D — Fix the relay only, keep synchronous refill (REJECTED as
insufficient; its relay fixes were ADOPTED as stage R1 and are LANDED).**
With the relay unblocked and a fast consumer, sync refill's duty cycle is
ioctl/(ioctl + consume) ≈ 3.3/(3.3+0.7–1.5) ≈ 70–83% at 1 MiB/command ⇒
~210–250 MB/s ceiling, below the 300 target, and fragile: any consumer hiccup
lands directly in the submission gap. R1 landed first so the physical
decomposition can attribute the submitter's own contribution honestly (§11).
The cost lens argued for gating R2 on leg-0 measurement; the owner overruled:
see §11.

## 3. Architecture

Three moving parts. The consumer machinery is *relocated and retyped* — the
panel killed v0.1's "reuse BatchingBlockSource verbatim" recipe (§3.3).

### 3.1 The read submitter (hot loop)

Runs on the drive-actor thread that owns the `DriveHandle` — no new
ownership or locking semantics, mirror of TIO-5 §3.2. **The drive-side
`BlockSource` moves INTO the submitter closure; no other thread can reach the
drive, by construction (§3.3, §5.4).** GOOD-path loop, in full: check the
reservoir gate (§4 — pass-through unless gated; resuming from ANY park
requires the §4.3 proof precondition to PASS first) → pop a free ring
buffer (blocking only when the pool is exhausted) → **recompute the record
count from post-classified-completion state** (the prior funnel outcome —
"decode" here never means the decode THREAD, which lags by reservoir depth
and plays no part in issue decisions):
`records = min(read_batch_blocks_effective, remaining_records_in_plan)`
→ call **`BlockSource::read_buffer_handoff`** (which is `read_block_batch`
— the single READ funnel, timeout class, CDB build, sense decode, position
arithmetic, tripwire, per-command audit events, diag histograms, **all
unmodified**) passing the fresh `remaining` (the funnel's own
`requested.min(remaining_records_in_file)` clamp at `tape_io/mod.rs:1342`
remains the backstop) → push the typed `Ok(SequencedHandoff)` (§3.2 — the
TIO-5b handoff plus ordered proof-frontier metadata) into the delivery
channel (never blocks, §3.2) → decrement `remaining_records_in_plan`
by `records_read` → repeat until the plan is exhausted.

- **Plan-bounded read-ahead:** the total records to read are known before
  the window opens (`tape_file.block_count` from the catalog for full-object
  reads; `plan.block_count` for ranged reads). The submitter reads ahead of
  the *consumer*, never ahead of the *plan*. No speculative record is ever
  issued, so approach C's backspace machinery stays unnecessary by
  construction.
- **Staged-next carries the BUFFER only — the count is recomputed before
  EVERY issue** (panel: concurrency #1; v0.1's "the next buffer and record
  count are already in hand" and §5.2's "armed intent survives as-is" are
  DELETED — carrying a count across even a full-count outcome over-reads the
  plan tail and violates the golden fixture). `StagedRead { buffer }` is host
  memory only; `records` is derived from `remaining_records_in_plan` at issue
  time, every time. The CDB is rebuilt per command
  (`build_read_fixed_cdb(records)`), same rule as the write side's
  partial-batch CDB rebuild. Because the staged READ never reaches the
  kernel early (approach B rejected), **cancellation is control flow and is
  always possible**: see §5.2. Hermetic assertion:
  `requested_records ≤ submitter_remaining` on every issue (§10) —
  **`submitter_remaining` is the rename of v0.2's `remaining_after_decode`
  (verify minor):** it is the submitter's own plan cursor after the prior
  *classified completion*; the decode-thread Σ is a diagnostic derived
  checksum only (§3.3), never an issue-decision input.
- **How read-ahead coexists with exactly one command in flight:** the
  submitter thread is *blocked inside* the SG_IO for the duration of each
  command — there is never a second command, staged or otherwise, at the
  transport. Read-ahead is achieved purely by what the submitter does NOT
  do between ioctls: no parse, no hash, no copy, no channel rendezvous with
  the network. On completion, the next buffer is in hand and the count is
  one subtraction away, so the next READ is issued within microseconds. The
  drive's own buffer, already filled ahead from tape, satisfies it
  immediately. Cadence ≈ ioctl + ε on ordinary commands; on tripwire-RP
  commands the cadence includes the periodic inline READ POSITION (a known,
  bounded, ~ms cost — stated so the cadence claim is not glossed). **This
  cadence model is write-side-derived and unverified for reads (§1.2) —
  leg 0/1 measures it.**
- Position seeding, the 1 GiB drift tripwire, and the 900 s TapeIo timeout
  class all live inside the funnel already
  (`seed_expected_position` is arithmetic when the cursor is cached;
  `advance_expected_position` fires the inline tripwire RP) — the submitter
  adds nothing and removes nothing.

### 3.2 Reservoir pool, channels, error-carrying delivery

Mirrors TIO-5 §3.1 with the buffer flow reversed (empty buffers flow to the
submitter; filled, typed handoffs flow away from it), with two v0.2 changes:
the buffer pool scales into the **read reservoir** (§4), and the delivery
channel **carries errors**:

- **Pool/reservoir:** the working set of `effective_read_batch_blocks ×
  block_size` buffers (1 MiB today: 4×256 KiB under the sg 1 MiB grant),
  page-aligned, checked allocation. Minimum depth = `staging_ring_buffers`
  (existing key, default 4, validated 2..=16; `BlockSource::read_ring_buffers`
  already plumbs it); maximum depth = the reservoir byte budget (§4.6–4.8),
  allocated incrementally on demand. Effective pool bytes logged at window
  open (write-side parity). Read and write sessions are mutually exclusive
  per drive, so the ring-depth key doubles no budget; the reservoir draws
  from the shared daemon RAM budget (§4.6).
- **Free channel:** capacity ≥ pool size, pre-seeded/grown with the pool.
  Buffer return (from decode thread, `into_reusable_buffer`) is therefore
  always non-blocking — the write side's no-credit-loop-wedge rule.
  **Construction assertion (panel nit):** at window open and after every
  growth step, `allocated_buffers == free_capacity_headroom ==
  delivery_capacity_headroom` — the non-blocking-push proof (below) is
  guarded by this assertion, not assumed from config.
- **Delivery channel:** bounded, element type
  **`Result<ReadDelivery, TapeIoError>`** where `ReadDelivery` is
  `Handoff(SequencedHandoff)` or a buffer-less **`ProofFrontier`** message
  (errors in-band: §5.6; proof frontier in-band: §5.5). Capacity = pool
  size in buffer-carrying elements plus a small fixed headroom for
  proof-only messages. The submitter can hold at most `pool` buffers
  across in-flight + queued, so its `Ok(Handoff)` push never blocks —
  asserted per the construction assertion. A proof-only push may block if
  that headroom is momentarily full — benign: every standalone RP happens
  at a pause point, holding no buffer, so blocking there IS the park (and
  a resume-time push always has headroom — the consumer just drained a
  full span). If any push fails (receiver dropped = consumer died), the
  submitter stops issuing immediately: **no tape motion for a dead
  client**, bounded by the one command already in flight.
- **Ownership handoff + proof metadata (verify major — v0.2's release
  bound was unimplementable with the bare handoff):** the data element
  wraps TIO-5b's type, unchanged, in ordered frontier metadata:
  `SequencedHandoff { seq: u64, plan_records_end: u64, position_after:
  TapePosition, evidence: PositionAfter, handoff: ReadBufferHandoff }`.
  `seq` is strictly monotonic per window; `plan_records_end` = Σ
  `records_read` through this handoff (the frontier cursor); `evidence`
  **preserves `ReadBatchOutcome::position_evidence`** —
  `Device(DevicePositionProof)` iff THIS command carried the funnel's
  inline tripwire RP (which proves the cursor through this command),
  `Computed` otherwise. **Standalone RPs ride a proof-only message, not a
  handoff:** the window-open RP, the mandatory §4.3 park-resume RP, and
  the §5.5 on-demand RP do not accompany a data command; each is delivered
  as `ProofFrontier { through_seq: u64, plan_records_end: u64, proof:
  DevicePositionProof }` naming the **exact cursor it proves — the LAST
  COMPLETED command** (`through_seq` = the highest `seq` already pushed;
  0-equivalent at window open). A resume RP therefore proves through the
  PREVIOUS command, never the next — the off-by-one that credited an RP
  to the command issued after it is closed by attaching every RP to the
  cursor it actually measured. Today
  `ReadBufferHandoff::from_outcome` (model.rs:522) DISCARDS the evidence;
  `read_buffer_handoff` therefore returns the outcome's evidence + position
  alongside the handoff so the pipeline can carry them. `ReadBufferHandoff`
  itself is unchanged — the typed exposure surface (`valid_bytes`
  truncation, stale-tail property) is untouched. `ReadBufferHandoff` moves
  the buffer by value; `valid_bytes`/`records_read`/terminal flags travel
  with it. Fail-closed funnel outcomes return `Err` and never surface a
  buffer — unchanged. The stale-tail property (sentinel-prefill test) is unchanged
  because the exposure surface — the typed handoff — is unchanged; §4.4
  adds the `bytes_transferred` cross-check because reservoir buffers now
  live far longer across reuse, which *amplifies* stale-tail exposure if a
  residual ever over-reports.
- **Terminal poison protocol** (mirror of TIO-5 §3.1 / pool_write.rs
  1568-1588, roles reversed): on any error the submitter (a) stops issuing,
  (b) sends `Err(classified_root_error)` down the delivery channel
  **exactly once** (or poisons the shared flag if the channel is gone),
  (c) drains the free channel without issuing CDBs. **Drop/join order
  (specified, panel minor):** submitter closes the delivery sender → decode
  thread drains remaining `Ok` items, sees the close (or the `Err`), drops
  its sender to the sender-thread channel → sender thread unwinds → joins in
  reverse spawn order. A decode thread parked in a blocking recv is always
  released by the channel close. **Stop detection is symmetric (panel
  minor):** the submitter treats *either* a delivery-push failure *or* a
  free-channel recv disconnect as consumer death — decode death is noticed
  on whichever channel the submitter touches first.

### 3.3 Consumer side: decode thread + sender thread (relocated AND retyped)

The two-thread restore relay split already exists
(`stream_with_staged_read_sender_diagnostics`: produce closure + sender
thread). Today the produce closure runs on the drive-actor thread. v0.1
proposed "reuse `BatchingBlockSource` with `refill`'s SCSI call swapped for
`recv()`, everything else byte-for-byte." **The panel killed that recipe
(SCSI-B1 + concurrency #2/#3, convergent):** `BatchingBlockSource` holds
`inner: &mut dyn BlockSource` — a live drive reference — so the "swap one
call" recipe puts a drive handle on the decode thread, making one-in-flight a
convention instead of a construction, and `refill` conflates
clamp/alloc/issue/validation, hiding a second divergent copy of the plan
state. v0.2:

- **`HandoffBlockSource` is a DISTINCT type holding `{delivery_receiver,
  free_sender, block_size, remaining}` and NO drive reference.** It cannot
  issue SCSI, by type. The drive-side `BlockSource` moves into the submitter
  closure (§3.1); the borrow checker enforces exclusivity.
- **A narrow read-only sub-trait for the format consumer.** `BlockSource`'s
  motion methods (`locate`/`space`/`position`) are *required trait members*
  — v0.1's "compile-time removal" on the full trait was inaccurate (the
  honest alternative was `unreachable!()` runtime panics). Instead, split
  the trait: `BlockRead` (`read_block`, `read_block_batch` surface, block
  geometry) as a super-trait or sibling of `BlockSource`, and the format
  layer's streaming entry points take `&mut dyn BlockRead`. Motion methods
  are absent from the decode thread **by type** — now genuinely
  compile-time. (Existing full-`BlockSource` callers are unaffected;
  `BlockSource: BlockRead`.)
- **Decode-side `remaining` is slaved, never recomputed:**
  `remaining = plan_total − Σ handoff.records_read`, decremented only by
  received handoffs. There is exactly one *authoritative* plan cursor (the
  submitter's `submitter_remaining`, §3.1); the decode-side counter is a
  derived diagnostic checksum of it — it lags by up to reservoir depth and
  never feeds an issue decision — and a mismatch at window close
  (Σ received ≠ Σ issued) is a fail-closed error, not a silent divergence.
- **Validation parity is a test obligation, not a code-reuse claim:** the
  consumer-side checks that today live in `refill` — the byte/record
  mismatch check, the filemark-before-plan-end fail-closed error,
  `read_block`'s per-record copy-out — are reimplemented on
  `HandoffBlockSource` and pinned by parity tests that assert byte-identical
  error behavior against today's `refill` (§10).
- The existing **sender thread** (`drain_staged_read_sender` →
  `ChannelWriter`) is retained with R1's landed mechanics; the per-chunk
  deadline is re-scoped by §4.5.
- **The decode→sender channel is sized in BYTES, and stated (panel:
  concurrency #4):** today's depth-2 rendezvous `sync_channel` re-couples
  SHA/parse to network jitter, undercutting the split. v0.2: byte-budgeted
  bounded channel (default 4 MiB, same budget arithmetic R1 landed for
  sender→tonic in `read_stream_channel_capacity`). The v0.1 Q4 question
  ("does the sender split still pay?") is contingent on this sizing and
  stays deferred-to-measurement.
- The format parse, hashing, and copies now run **concurrent with the next
  SG_IO** instead of inside its gap. Consumer budget at 300 MB/s: one
  256 KiB copy-out per record + SHA-256 (~1.5–2 GB/s with SHA extensions —
  **dev box CONFIRMED `sha_ni` 2026-07-11 (Ryzen 3700X); the DL385 EPYC is
  architecturally ≥Zen1 and therefore has it, one-line `grep sha_ni
  /proc/cpuinfo` confirm at leg 0 before the number is trusted**) + one
  `to_vec` per emitted slice ≈ 25–40% of one core (§7.2). If a future
  profile shows the decode thread itself binding, the split point between
  decode and sender can move — measurement-triggered follow-up, not R2
  scope.

### 3.4 Layering: transport ⊥ verification (owner decision)

Stated as a design principle because it decides where code lives and
reinforces the no-drive-on-decode-thread construction:

- **The transport (submitter + reservoir + sender) is FORMAT-BLIND.** It
  moves opaque, proven-complete records; it never touches SHA, never parses,
  never knows what a RAO object is. Its integrity obligations are exactly
  the funnel's: typed `valid_bytes`, the §4.4 cross-checks, position proof.
- **Verification lives in the format/decode layer**, using the RAO object's
  **self-describing in-band manifest checksums — read from the object on
  tape, NEVER from the catalog.** The catalog *locates* (which tape, which
  file number, how many blocks); it is never the integrity reference. A
  restore therefore verifies against what the tape itself claims to
  contain, end-to-end, with zero catalog trust in the data path.
- **A different-format plugin brings its own decode-layer verification (or
  none); the transport is unchanged.** This is the plugin seam: format
  drivers get `&mut dyn BlockRead` + their own manifest semantics.
- **SHA-256 stays inline on the decode thread** (v0.1 Q2, owner-confirmed):
  hash-at-restore is the right default for an archive; the budget holds
  with SHA-NI (§3.3); a silent restore-without-verify mode is not offered.

### 3.5 Session integration

`stream_one_object` / `stream_one_file_range` keep their signatures and
catalog work. **Positioning state is per-MOUNT, not per-object (panel,
convergent):** `verify_loaded_tape_identity` (rewind + BOT bootstrap check)
runs once per mount/session, not per restored object; per-object work within
a verified mount is SPACE/LOCATE to the tape file only. The pipelined window
covers the record-transfer phase of each object, mirroring the write side
(position seeding and motion never prep-ahead). v0.1's §7 model was
single-large-object; production restores are "pull N clips" — per-object
positioning + window spawn/join then dominates exactly as it ate the write
field number (~65 s/object). v0.2 therefore: (a) adds a **multi-object
acceptance leg** (§10 leg 4) so the shipped number is a restore-workload
number, not a single-object best case; (b) **names the follow-up arc
honestly:** amortizing inter-object positioning (position-ordered restore
plans, LOCATE vs SPACE selection, batched inter-object motion) may be worth
more than the submitter on clip-pull workloads — out of R2 scope, named in
INDEX as the next candidate arc.

Ranged reads (`read_plaintext_file_range` / `stream_one_file_range`) are
**reworked onto the same pipeline** — see §5.5; v0.1 had left them as a
second synchronous consumer, which falsified the one-path claim. CLI
break-glass reads (`rem-debug archive read`) route through the same core
with a file-writer consumer; there is exactly ONE read transfer path after
this lands (v0.7 one-path rule — no `read_pipeline` flag, no legacy refill
mode kept; backout is git revert + previous binary). Mid-object restore
resume does not exist and is not designed here (panel nit — named): a failed
restore restarts from object start; the reservoir's volatility (§4.7) is
consistent with that.

### 3.6 Diag restructure (decomposition under overlap)

TIO-5b's restore decomposition assumes serial phases
(`relay = wall − position − transfer`, `exclusive_restore_relay_phase`).
Under overlap that subtraction is meaningless — transfer and relay run
concurrently. The diag moves to per-thread busy/idle accounting:

- Submitter: existing `gap_us`/`ioctl_us` histograms (recorded in the
  funnel, **unchanged**) plus new pipeline-side `free_wait_us` (blocked on
  the free channel) and `park_us` (reservoir gate, §4). **`gap_us` will now
  include deliberate waits** (free-wait, park) because the funnel measures
  completion→next-submit and cannot know why the gap happened; the pipeline
  therefore also records a derived `feed_gap_us = gap − free_wait − park`
  per iteration, and **acceptance gates read `feed_gap_us`** (panel minor:
  no double-counting, no polluted feed-health signal). `free_wait_us` high ⇒
  consumer-bound; `park_us` accumulating ⇒ slow consumer parking the
  drive (§4).
- Decode thread: busy time (parse+hash) vs recv-wait (drive-bound signal).
- Sender: busy vs channel-wait, plus R1's landed `sender_stall_ms`.
- **Per-command audit events are RETAINED (panel BLOCKER resolved):** v0.1
  §8's coalesced TapeRead window span required either modifying
  `read_block_batch` (which fires `fire_tape_started`/`finish_tape_success`
  per command, mod.rs:1359/1392) or forking an audit-free
  `read_block_batch_pipelined` — the exact ~200-line fork that produced
  TIO-5a's six defects. The audit hook is `None`/unwired in production and
  a per-command event costs nanoseconds. **Coalescing is DROPPED.** The
  funnel is wrapped truly unmodified. If forensic coalescing is ever wanted,
  the rule is: extract an audit-free CORE called by both entry points —
  never a fork. The window-open intent marker (planned CDB count/bytes,
  write-side forensic parity) is kept — it is emitted by the pipeline,
  outside the funnel.
- **Three threads now write diag concurrently (panel minor):** counters and
  histograms shared across threads are atomics, or thread-local and merged
  at post-join snapshot; no torn reads in the restore_total line.
- The restore_total diag line keeps its fields; `relay_ms` becomes
  sender-busy, and a new `bottleneck=` field names the thread with the
  highest busy fraction. New reservoir gauges: occupancy bytes (live),
  withheld-pending-proof bytes (§5.5, separate gauge), park/resume cycle
  count. **A live signal, not just
  session-close accounting (panel minor):** reservoir occupancy + park
  count are readable mid-session from shared diag state and feed the
  Drishti signal (§8).
- All in-place counters/histograms, zero per-command allocation, read from
  shared diag state, never via a `DriveCommand` (actor busy for the window —
  unchanged known property).

## 4. The read reservoir — watermark stop-start, anti-shoe-shine (owner reversal — CORE)

**v0.1 §4 said "reads accept shoe-shine." The owner REJECTED that.** The
throughput lens had already shown the dismissal was on the wrong grounds:
host buffering cannot raise sustained throughput above the consumer's rate
(still true, kept below), but it directly cuts **reposition frequency** —
which is the wear term. And "restores are rarer than ingests" is wrong for
this archive's access pole: a newsroom restore over 1GbE would shoe-shine
continuously for the whole session. Anti-shoe-shine is now a core mechanism
of R2, not an accepted defect.

### 4.1 The mechanism: a watermark-controlled host-RAM read reservoir

The buffer pool of §3.2 scales from a 4-buffer jitter ring into a large,
byte-budgeted **read reservoir** with configurable **high/low watermarks**
(rem config keys, §4.8):

- **Fill:** the submitter runs at full drive speed into the reservoir
  (reservoir occupancy = filled, not-yet-consumed handoff bytes).
- **At high-water: STOP issuing READs.** The drive, seeing no host demand,
  parks cleanly — **one** deliberate stop, instead of continuous
  backhitching at the speed-matching band floor.
- **Drain:** the decode/sender threads keep consuming from the reservoir at
  the consumer's own pace. The drive sits parked, wearing nothing.
- **At low-water: resume** — a single reposition + position re-proof
  (§4.3), then full-speed fill again.

**Wear arithmetic (the point — made self-consistent, v0.4):** for a
consumer at rate `c` against drive rate `d` with
`span = (high_pct − low_pct) × effective_reservoir_bytes` (the watermark
DELTA — not the full reservoir):

- **cycles per restore ≈ `restore_bytes × (d−c) ÷ (d × span)`** — each
  cycle moves `d·span/(d−c)` bytes off tape (the consumer keeps draining
  during refill), so the slow-consumer LIMIT `restore_bytes ÷ span` is the
  upper bound (c→0), not the estimate.
- **cycle rate = `3600 ÷ (span/c + span/(d−c))` cycles/hr** —
  drain-while-parked plus refill-while-still-draining. The two formulas
  are the same model (rate × duration = count).

The owner's example: a 100 GB reservoir at 90/25 has a 65 GB span ⇒
≤ **277 clean stop-starts** for a full 18 TB LTO-9 stream (≈175 at a
110 MB/s consumer) — versus continuous shoe-shining for the whole
multi-hour session without it. Typical clip-pull restores are far smaller
than a full tape, so typical cycle counts are single digits. The knob is
RAM, which is cheap and reusable; the thing it buys is head/media life,
which is not.

**Anti-wear target (the number the default is derived from):** the design
target is **≤ 60 park/resume cycles/hour sustained** at the worst-case
consumer rate. Provenance: engineering judgment — roughly one clean
stop-start per minute, an order-plus below continuous shoe-shine's
backhitch-every-few-seconds (~10³/hr) — pending vendor mechanism-life data
and leg-3 qualification; it is a stated, revisable choice, not physics.
Cycle time is minimized (rate maximized) at **`c = d/2`** — that is the
worst case the §4.8 default is derived from; both slower and faster
consumers cycle less often. Per-full-tape totals are reported as an
observation, not a second target (a full-tape slow-consumer restore is a
pathological workload — §4.8's sizing guidance covers it with a bigger
reservoir).

**What the reservoir cannot do (unchanged honesty from v0.1):** sustained
end-to-end throughput is still `min(chain)` — a 110 MB/s consumer gets
110 MB/s. The reservoir changes the drive's *duty pattern* (long full-speed
bursts + parks instead of slow crawl/backhitch), not the average.

### 4.2 One regime: watermark stop-start

**v0.3's second, "gentle speed-matching" regime (IN_BAND: consumer-EWMA
regime selector, per-command gating at `high − ε`, park detectors) is
REMOVED — owner 2026-07-11: fold-introduced over-engineering** that
generated most of the re-verify majors (a park detector with nothing to
observe — no reposition counter exists in
`crates/remanence-scsi/src/log_sense.rs`, ioctl latency is a guess; a
per-command READ POSITION reintroducing the tax TIO-5 removed; a
resume-RP off-by-one). The wear guarantee never depended on it:

- **Fast consumer (≥ drive streaming rate):** the reservoir hovers near
  empty; read-ahead keeps the drive streaming at native rate (→300 MB/s).
  Watermarks never trip. This is the §3 submitter story, unchanged.
- **Every slower consumer:** fill at whatever rate the drive gives (the
  drive's own hardware speed-matching governs the instantaneous fill rate
  — no software control law, no consumer-rate estimation, no park
  detection); at **high-water STOP issuing READs** — the drive, seeing no
  demand, parks cleanly; **drain to low-water; resume** (§4.3 proof
  first). That is the whole mechanism.

**Why no park detection is needed:** the reservoir bounds reposition
COUNT by construction — §4.1's arithmetic (≈ `restore_bytes × (d−c) /
(d × span)`) is the wear guarantee, and it holds regardless of what the
drive's servo does between watermarks. The design promises clean bounded
stop-starts, not zero of them.

**Overshoot bound (kept from v0.3):** the gate is checked before issue and
exactly one command is ever in flight, so occupancy exceeds high-water by
at most one command's bytes — asserted in the hermetic rows (§10).

### 4.3 SAFETY: park and resume never weaken position trust

- **Pauses happen only at command boundaries with a fully classified prior
  outcome.** The gate sits at the top of the submitter loop (§3.1), before
  buffer pop and count recompute — never mid-command, never between a
  CHECK CONDITION and its decode. **A pause can never straddle a filemark:**
  reads are plan-bounded within one tape file; a FILEMARK outcome mid-plan
  is already a fail-closed error (§5.1) and ends the window — there is no
  state in which the submitter parks with an unresolved boundary.
- **Position is RE-PROVEN on resume — no duration proxy for deliberate
  pauses (verify major: v0.2's 250 ms threshold was an unqualified parking
  proxy; nothing establishes this drive cannot reposition inside a shorter
  pause).** Two pause classes, two rules:
  - **Watermark parks — every park→resume, MANDATORY, regardless of
    duration:** the first command on resume is an explicit
    **READ POSITION**, verified against the expected cursor via the
    existing `DevicePositionProof` machinery, and **the passing proof is
    an explicit precondition for the next READ** — encoded as submitter
    states `GATED → RESUMING(rp-pending) → FILLING`, where FILLING is
    reachable only through a passing proof. The resume RP **proves the
    cursor through the LAST COMPLETED command** (nothing has moved since)
    and enters the §5.5 frontier as a `ProofFrontier` message attached to
    exactly that seq/cursor — never credited to the command about to be
    issued. Cost: one ~1 ms RP per park/resume cycle — noise against a
    multi-second reposition.
  - **Incidental waits** (free-channel wait with the gate open — decode
    slow returning buffers): re-proof before the next READ when the wait
    exceeded **`T_REPROOF_INCIDENTAL` = 250 ms — a named, non-configurable
    code constant** (not a config key; §4.8 records that explicitly).
    This one IS a heuristic and is labeled so: leg 3 measures the drive's
    minimum observed park latency, and if the drive can stop in under
    250 ms the constant is dropped in favor of conservative
    always-re-proof. Incidental waits under healthy streaming are
    microseconds; the constant exists only to keep the hot path free of
    RPs where no real pause happened.

  Mismatch ⇒ `mark_position_unknown()` + poison — identical to the
  tripwire path. The 1 GiB drift tripwire continues unchanged on top of
  this; park re-proof is additional, not a replacement.
- The drive's own reposition on resume is the drive's business (it re-ramps
  and relocates to where its buffer left off); rem's obligation is exactly
  the re-proof above — trust nothing across a park that has not been proven.

### 4.4 INTEGRITY: only proven-complete records enter the reservoir

Reservoir entry *is* the typed handoff push — there is no other door:

- A buffer enters the reservoir only inside an `Ok(SequencedHandoff)`
  wrapping a `ReadBufferHandoff` whose
  `valid_bytes`/`records_read` came from the funnel's sense decode.
  Fail-closed outcomes never surface a buffer (TIO-5b, unchanged).
- **NEW — `bytes_transferred` cross-check (panel, convergent, funnel
  hardening):** today the funnel destructures `bytes_transferred` from
  `CheckCondition` (mod.rs:1400-1402) and then derives `records_read` from
  the sense INFORMATION residual alone on the filemark and recovered paths.
  An over-reported residual would mint `valid_bytes` beyond what the
  transport actually moved — and under reservoir-scale buffer reuse that
  exposes a PRIOR window's real tape data, strictly worse than the sentinel
  case. v0.2 requires, on every residual-derived success path:
  `records_read × block_size ≤ bytes_transferred`, **fail-closed
  (completion-unknown) on disagreement**, with a hermetic test. This lands
  **inside the one READ funnel** (`read_block_batch`) as a prerequisite
  hardening commit that benefits every read caller — a shared-funnel safety
  fix, not a pipeline fork.
- **Write-side scope, ENUMERATED (verify major — v0.2's "the write path
  gets the symmetric check in the same commit" glossed a false premise:
  reads and writes do NOT share a funnel, and there are TWO write entry
  points with different recovered/EOM arbitration — `write_block_batch`
  (mod.rs:958) and `write_block_batch_pipelined` (mod.rs:1119)).** The
  cross-direction hardening is a **shared pure HELPER** called from
  enumerated sites, never a claim of shared control flow:
  - **Helper:** `validate_residual_claim(records_claimed, block_size,
    bytes_transferred) → Result<(), CompletionUnknown>` — fails iff
    `records_claimed × block_size > bytes_transferred`. One-sided (`≤`)
    by design; see transport semantics below for why.
  - **`read_block_batch` sites:** the FILEMARK+residual path
    (mod.rs:1422) and the recovered-no-terminal path (mod.rs:1451) — the
    checks stay in the read funnel as specified above.
  - **`write_block_batch` sites:** (1) the recovered-no-terminal-flags
    full-batch path (mod.rs:1060) — claim = full `records`; (2) the
    residual-derived partial-completion fall-through (mod.rs:1079) —
    claim = `records_written` from sense INFORMATION. **NOT the EOM/EW
    path (mod.rs:1021):** there `records_written` comes from the
    post-event READ POSITION delta (`records_delta_between`) —
    device-position arbitration remains the SOLE authority on that path;
    a `bytes_transferred` disagreement there is recorded as diag only and
    never overrides the device position.
  - **`write_block_batch_pipelined` sites:** (1) the
    recovered-no-terminal path (mod.rs:1271) — claim = full `records`;
    (2) the non-EOM fall-through that populates
    `PartialBatchUncommittable.written_records` from the residual
    (mod.rs:1294) — on helper failure the error DEGRADES to
    `completion_unknown_check_condition` rather than asserting a specific
    written count. The EOM/EW path (mod.rs:1214; delta at
    mod.rs:1239–1245) keeps device-position arbitration untouched, helper
    diag-only — same rule as the ordinary funnel. (The `unwrap_or(0)`
    reporting count inside `WriteFailureWithPositionError`
    (mod.rs:1221–1224) is error-payload reporting on a path already
    failing for position reasons — out of scope, noted.)
  - **Transport `bytes_transferred` semantics (verified, not assumed):**
    the sg transport computes `bytes_transferred = dxfer_len − resid`,
    **clamped to 0 when resid is out of range**
    (`remanence-scsi/src/sg_io.rs:249`), identically for data-in and
    data-out. Consequences: (a) a garbage resid clamps to 0, so any
    nonzero claim fails ⇒ completion-unknown — conservative and correct,
    test row; (b) data-out residual reporting is HBA/driver-dependent —
    a stack that never reports data-out resid yields `bytes_transferred =
    dxfer_len`, making the write-side check **vacuously satisfied (safe:
    it can never spuriously fail) but not protective on that stack**.
    Implementation obligation: hermetic model-transport rows in both
    directions, plus a leg-0 probe recording whether the E208e/mpt3sas
    path reports nonzero data-out resid on a forced partial; if it does
    not, the write-side check is documented as vacuous on this stack and
    still lands (it protects stacks that do report).
  - **Parity tests (§10):** identical sense fixtures driven through BOTH
    write entry points must produce identical helper accept/degrade
    decisions, and the existing EOM/EW arbitration tests must pass
    byte-identically — the proof that the helper changed no landed write
    behavior.
- **NEW — impossible-residual fail-closed (panel SCSI-M4, st O7):** a
  RECOVERED ERROR with **no** terminal flag but a VALID nonzero residual is
  physically incoherent for fixed-mode reads — trusting it as a short read
  advances the cursor BEHIND the physical tape, and read-ahead then delivers
  wrong-position data. v0.2: on the recovered-no-terminal-flags path,
  require residual == 0; VALID nonzero residual ⇒ completion-unknown/poison.
  The current `unwrap_or(records)` (mod.rs:1453) remains only for the
  VALID-bit-unset case. Same funnel-hardening commit; §5.1 row updated.
- Same commit, same rationale (pre-existing, panel m6):
  `is_reset_unit_attention` covers 06/29/00..04 but not 29/07 (I_T NEXUS
  LOSS), which is equally state-invalidating — added.

### 4.5 TRUST: liveness ≠ slowness (panel convergent on R1, resolved)

The panel caught v0.1's 30 s send-deadline contradicting its own
slow-consumer story: a 1GbE client pausing >30 s (GC, flush) got killed,
while a genuinely dead peer was invisible to a send-stall timer anyway.
Owner decision resolves it:

- **Slow-but-alive ⇒ park and wait. Indefinitely.** The reservoir + parked
  drive means a stalled-but-connected client no longer costs tape motion or
  submission-gap pollution — it costs RAM (already reserved) and the drive
  *reservation*. No automatic abort for alive peers.
- **DEAD peer ⇒ abort via h2/TCP connection state, NOT a send-stall
  timeout.** Detection chain: client disconnect (RST/FIN or RPC cancel)
  drops the tonic response future → the read-stream receiver drops → R1's
  landed receiver-drop watchdog already converts a blocked sender into an
  immediate `BrokenPipe`. For half-open TCP (client power loss, no FIN),
  the daemon enables **HTTP/2 keepalive PING with CONCRETE settings
  (verify major: v0.2 pointed at `reference-configuration.md`, which today
  records only the 4 MiB h2 windows — no keepalive exists anywhere yet;
  the R2 commit adds these as compiled transport defaults alongside the
  windows, in code and in that doc):**
  - **Server (tonic builder, both listeners):**
    `http2_keepalive_interval = 30 s`, `http2_keepalive_timeout = 20 s` —
    on the TCP/mTLS listener where half-open is real, and identically on
    the Unix socket for uniformity (peer death there is kernel-reported
    anyway; the PING is harmless).
  - **Client (sutra-agent deliverable, §11.3):**
    `http2_keep_alive_interval = 30 s`, `keep_alive_timeout = 20 s`,
    `keep_alive_while_idle = true` on the `Endpoint`.
  - **PING runs while idle/stalled — required, not assumed:** PING is a
    connection-level frame and must fire while streams are idle or
    send-stalled (a parked reservoir behind a stalled sender is exactly
    the guarded state). This property is asserted against the pinned
    tonic/hyper version at implementation time, and the required test is
    the **half-open-while-parked row** (§10): traffic dropped without FIN
    while the drive is parked ⇒ connection, stream, receiver, and session
    all tear down within ≈ interval + timeout (≤ ~50 s; test bound 2×),
    the poison drain runs, and the drive never moves. Detection is thereby
    bounded independent of send progress — which is what makes the
    slow-but-alive park-indefinitely owner decision coherent.
- **R1's 30 s per-chunk `send_with_timeout` deadline is RE-SCOPED in R2:**
  it stops being a client-kill policy and becomes a diagnostic tick — on
  expiry the sender records the stall (Drishti signal, §8) and re-arms; it
  aborts only on channel closure (`BrokenPipe`), i.e. on proven death. (R1
  as landed keeps the 30 s abort in the interim — acceptable pre-R2 because
  without a reservoir a stalled client pins the drive, which is the worse
  evil; the re-scope ships with R2, where parking makes patience safe.)
- **Honest occupancy consequence:** a parked restore holds the drive
  reservation for as long as the client stays alive. The remedy is
  operator-visible (Drishti slow-restore alert + live reservoir/park gauges)
  and operator-actuated (cancel the session). Pre-production rule: no
  auto-eviction machinery, no idle-policy knobs — if the field shows
  parked-forever sessions are a real operational problem, that is a future
  policy design with its own review.

### 4.6 RAM guardrails — fixed ceiling, atomic reservation (verify major: rewritten)

v0.2's rules could not deliver their own heading: `MemAvailable` is a
transient observation, not a reservation (two streams can both pass the
same check and jointly overshoot); the shared ceiling was named but never
defined; and "mlock fails ⇒ clamp to minimum pool" contradicted "resident,
non-swappable". Replaced wholesale:

- **One FIXED daemon I/O-memory ceiling.** A new config key,
  `daemon.io_memory_ceiling` (byte size, validated > 0; §4.8), is the
  fixed total for ALL pipeline I/O memory: append-spool reservations
  (`spool_tmpfs_ram_budget` generalizes INTO this ceiling — validation:
  spool budget ≤ ceiling) plus every drive's read reservoir. Deployment
  requirement, documented in `reference-configuration.md`: the daemon unit
  runs under a cgroup memory limit (systemd `MemoryMax`) with
  `io_memory_ceiling + daemon baseline headroom ≤ MemoryMax` (guidance:
  leave ≥ 2 GiB), plus `LimitMEMLOCK` sized ≥ the ceiling.
  `MemAvailable` and `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` are consulted ONCE at startup as
  loud sanity warnings (ceiling exceeds available RAM or the memlock
  allowance ⇒ warn, naming the limit); they are never runtime authority —
  the ceiling is the authority, the cgroup limit is the enforcement
  backstop.
- **Atomic reservation manager, permits before allocation.** One
  `IoMemoryReservation` manager (generalizing the TIO-5b
  `spool_tmpfs_ram_budget` semaphore machinery in
  `remanence-api/src/lib.rs`) owns the ceiling. Order, per RESERVOIR
  slab: **reserve byte permit → allocate (checked, page-aligned) →
  `mlock`** — failure at ANY step rolls the permit back before the error
  propagates (RAII permits). Spool growth reserves permits from the SAME
  ceiling but its tmpfs pages are not mlocked (scoping below). The
  manager's invariant — Σ outstanding permits ≤ ceiling — is asserted and
  RACED in tests: two streams plus the spool growing concurrently against
  a near-exhausted ceiling, granted permits never exceeding it (the
  concurrent-growth race row, §10 — not merely second-stream startup).
- **Minimum pool locks or the window REFUSES.** A window opens only if its
  minimum pool (`staging_ring_buffers` buffers) can be reserved,
  allocated, AND mlocked. If minimum mlock fails, the window refuses to
  start with an error naming `LimitMEMLOCK`. There is NO swappable
  fallback ring — v0.2's clamp silently shipped swappable memory under a
  "never swap" banner; the honest choices were refuse or explicitly
  permit a swappable legacy minimum, and this design REFUSES (fail-closed
  culture; the fix is the unit file, not a degraded mode).
- **Claim scoping (verify major, v0.4 sharpened):** never-swap is a
  **RESERVOIR-only** guarantee — every reservoir slab byte in a running
  window is mlocked. The tmpfs `Spool` is **ceiling-RESERVED but NOT
  guaranteed-resident**: tmpfs pages are file-backed and swappable under
  memory pressure; the reservation bounds the spool's SIZE against the
  ceiling, and no never-swap claim is made for it (its durability story
  never depended on residency — it is a pre-commit spool). Never-OOM is a
  statement about this daemon's reservations under its cgroup limit
  (`io_memory_ceiling + baseline headroom ≤ MemoryMax`); other processes
  on the box are the cgroup's job, not a promise this design can make.
- **Incremental growth, same funnel:** reservoir slabs are allocated on
  demand during fill through the same reserve→alloc→mlock sequence; a
  growth-step failure (permit denied or mlock refused) is non-fatal —
  growth stops, the current size becomes the effective cap, warned once
  in the window log line and diag; the window continues on its already-
  locked bytes. Never a single up-front multi-GB allocation spike.
- **Per-drive, per-stream:** each concurrent restore stream owns its own
  reservoir; dual-drive concurrent restore = two reservations from the one
  ceiling — integrating the TIO-5 dual-drive RAM budget question rather
  than duplicating it. A second stream that cannot reserve its configured
  size clamps-and-warns down to what the ceiling allows — never below the
  mlocked minimum pool (below that: refuse, as above).

### 4.7 Volatile-is-safe

The reservoir is process RAM, deliberately: a crash/kill loses buffered
records, the session dies, the client sees a stream reset, and the re-issued
restore re-reads from tape. Reads are non-mutating; there is **zero data
risk** in losing the reservoir, therefore **no persistence, no journal, no
spool file** — restore-to-spool was v0.1's rejected strawman and stays
rejected. Crash rows in §9.

### 4.8 Config keys (documented in `reference-configuration.md`)

read_reservoir_high_pct      = 90       # NEW: stop-issuing threshold (% of effective cap)
read_reservoir_low_pct       = 25       # NEW: resume threshold (% of effective cap)
position_check_bytes_ranged  = "256MiB" # NEW (§5.5): proof cadence, hash-less windows
```

`T_REPROOF_INCIDENTAL` (250 ms, §4.3) is deliberately NOT a config key —
a named code constant (verify minor: v0.2 called `T_reproof` a "default"
while listing no key). It never touches deliberate-park decisions (§4.3).
(v0.3's `read_drive_floor_mib_s` and `park_detect_ioctl_ms` are GONE with
the IN_BAND regime — nothing consumes a floor or a park detector.)

Validation, fail-closed at config load: `0 < low_pct < high_pct ≤ 100`
(degenerate `high ≤ low` REJECTED, per owner), `read_reservoir_bytes ≥`
minimum pool bytes, `spool_tmpfs_ram_budget ≤ io_memory_ceiling`,
per-stream reservoir ≤ ceiling; the effective ranged proof cadence is
clamped to `min(position_check_bytes_ranged, effective_reservoir_bytes /
2)` (§5.5).

**The 8 GiB default is DERIVED, not chosen by feel:** from the §4.1
anti-wear target (≤ 60 cycles/hr) at the worst-case consumer rate
`c = d/2` against a ~300 MB/s drive: cycle time `span/c + span/(d−c) =
4·span/d ≥ 60 s` ⇒ `span ≥ 15·d ≈ 4.4 GiB`, and span = 65% of the
reservoir at 90/25 ⇒ reservoir ≥ ~6.8 GiB, rounded up to **8 GiB**
(span 5.2 GiB ⇒ ~51 cycles/hr worst-case; both slower and faster
consumers cycle LESS often). Re-derived if leg 3 moves the drive-rate
anchor. Sizing guidance in the reference doc: parks-per-restore ≈
`restore_bytes × (d−c) ÷ (d × span)`, bounded by `restore_bytes ÷ span`
(§4.1); the owner's 100 GB example yields ≤ 277 parks per full 18 TB tape
at ~6/hr-class cycle rates. **4 GiB is an experimental MINIMUM for
small-RAM hosts, not a sane anti-wear default**: at 90/25 its 2.6 GiB
span gives ~100 cycles/hr worst-case and ~4,500 cycles across a full
18 TiB restore at a 110 MiB/s consumer — far above the target; the config
comment and reference doc must say so. Restore-heavy deployments with
slow consumers SHOULD raise the reservoir (100 GB-class for full-tape
slow-consumer workloads); the Drishti reposition-rate signal (§8) is the
tell that a deployment needs a bigger reservoir.

## 5. Safety composition — one funnel, wrapped, never duplicated

The submitter calls `read_buffer_handoff` → `read_block_batch` —
**unmodified by the pipeline**. Every TIO-5b behavior holds because the code
that implements it is the code that runs. Two clarifications sharpen this
from v0.1: (a) per-command audit events are RETAINED (§3.6) — the funnel is
not forked for coalescing; (b) the §4.4 read-hardening items
(`bytes_transferred` cross-check, impossible-residual, 29/07) land **inside
the one READ funnel** as a prerequisite commit for every read caller — a
safety fix to the funnel is not a fork of it. **"One funnel" is a
PER-DIRECTION statement (verify major):** reads have exactly one
(`read_block_batch`); the write side has TWO entry points with their own
recovered/EOM arbitration (`write_block_batch`,
`write_block_batch_pipelined`), and the write-facing hardening is the
enumerated shared HELPER of §4.4 — never a claim that writes ride this
funnel. What pipelining adds is *what the
submitter does with each classified outcome*:

### 5.1 Outcome table

| Funnel outcome (TIO-5b + §4.4 hardening) | Funnel does | Submitter consequence (new) |
|---|---|---|
| GOOD, full batch | cursor advanced arithmetically; tripwire RP when due; diag recorded | push `Ok(handoff)`; decrement plan; recompute count; issue next |
| GOOD batch, **inline tripwire RP FAILS** (panel: row was missing) | `mark_position_unknown()`; `Err` — the batch's data is NOT surfaced (fail-closed, position unproven) | staged buffer discarded; poison protocol; no further data CDB without reposition + proof |
| Current RECOVERED ERROR, no terminal flags, **residual == 0 or VALID unset** (st F2 — the common case is a FULL batch, panel nit n7) | success; `valid_bytes` = proven-complete records; audited-as-recovered | push `Ok(handoff)`; decrement plan by actual `records_read`; recompute count; continue |
| Current RECOVERED ERROR, no terminal flags, **VALID nonzero residual** (§4.4 — physically impossible for fixed reads, st O7) | **completion-unknown `Err` (NEW, fail-closed)** | poison protocol; stop |
| FILEMARK + residual | `Ok` with `filemark=true`, `records_read` from sense INFORMATION **cross-checked vs `bytes_transferred` (§4.4)**; cursor advanced incl. the mark | staged buffer discarded. Plan not exhausted ⇒ truncated object ⇒ fail-closed error to consumer (exactly today's `refill` rule); no further CDBs. A filemark can never be crossed by a stale staged READ because the staged READ was never in the kernel |
| Fixed-mode ILI (st F4) | `mark_position_unknown()`; `Err`; handoff withheld | staged buffer discarded; poison protocol; **no further data CDB is even possible** — `ensure_data_command_state_valid` refuses until explicit reposition + device position proof |
| Reset-UA `06/29/xx` incl. **29/07 I_T NEXUS LOSS (§4.4)** (st F1) | `invalidate_for_reset_unit_attention()` (cursor + cached mode validation); `Err` | same as ILI, plus mode re-verification required before any data command — enforced by the funnel's gate, not by submitter discipline |
| Deferred sense 0x71/0x73 | completion-unknown `Err` | poison protocol; stop |
| Transport error / undecodable | `Err` via `map_scsi` | poison protocol; stop |
| Tripwire RP mismatch (periodic or §4.3 park re-proof) | `mark_position_unknown()`; `Err` | poison protocol; stop |

### 5.2 The staged-READ-cancel interaction, made explicit

The tricky case the charter names: a pre-staged READ that must be cancelled
because the *prior* command's outcome (residual, filemark, ILI, error)
invalidates its parameters. Design (tightened per panel concurrency #1):

- `StagedRead` carries the **buffer only**. The record count is recomputed
  as `min(batch, remaining_records_in_plan)` from post-classified-completion
  state before
  **every** issue — full-count outcomes included. There is no "armed intent
  survives as-is" fast path (v0.1 wording deleted): carrying a count across
  the plan tail requests `batch` where `remaining < batch`, and while the
  funnel's own clamp (mod.rs:1342) would rescue correctness when passed
  fresh `remaining`, the design does not lean on the backstop — the
  submitter passes fresh values and asserts them.
- **Invalidation rule:** any funnel return where
  `records_read != records_requested` **or** any terminal flag is set
  **or** `Err` ⇒ the staged buffer is discarded/recycled *before* any issue,
  and `remaining_records_in_plan` / clamp are recomputed from
  post-classified-completion state (`records_read`, cursor validity).
- Because approach B was rejected, the staged READ exists only as host
  memory: cancellation cannot fail, cannot race the transport, and needs no
  kernel cooperation. This is TIO-5b's staged-CDB-cancel machinery promoted
  from a single-refill property to a loop invariant, with hermetic
  assertions (§10): **no READ CDB is ever issued whose record count exceeds
  `submitter_remaining` (the post-classified-completion plan cursor, §3.1)
  — under every outcome in the matrix, including all-GOOD tails.**

### 5.3 New failure surfaces introduced by pipelining (owned honestly)

- **Consumer death mid-window** (client disconnect, decode panic): delivery
  push fails or free-channel recv disconnects (§3.2, symmetric detection) ⇒
  submitter stops after the in-flight command; poison; drain; the
  drive-actor returns to its command loop. Bounded over-read: ≤ reservoir
  buffers already filled + 1 in flight — all discarded, no delivery. Test
  row, §10.
- **Submitter death / process kill:** reads are non-mutating; there is no
  fence, no journal, no commit exposure. Recovery is the ordinary readiness
  path (position distrust on reopen). TIO-5b's chaos row (drop-side never
  issues a destructor READ) extends to the full three-thread scope. Crash
  table, §9.
- **Poisoned-window buffer leak:** pool accounting (allocated == returned
  or dropped-with-window) asserted at window close, mirroring the write
  side's `RingAccounting` imbalance check — now covering incremental
  reservoir growth (§4.6).
- **Parked-drive surfaces (NEW with §4):** position staleness across a park
  — covered by resume re-proof (§4.3); RAM reservation held by a parked
  session — covered by budget accounting + Drishti visibility (§4.5/§4.6);
  a park that never resumes (client alive, zero progress) — operator-visible
  and operator-cancelled, no auto-eviction (§4.5).
- **Abort latency:** operator abort cannot interrupt a mid-ioctl submitter
  (known TIO-3/5 property, unchanged); with 900 s TapeIo timeouts a hung
  READ occupies the actor for up to 900 s. A *parked* submitter (§4), by
  contrast, is abortable immediately — parking improves abort latency in
  the slow-consumer case. Stated for the record.

### 5.4 Motion fencing — by type

During a pipelined window the submitter owns the drive exclusively (it IS
the drive-actor thread, and the drive-side `BlockSource` lives inside its
closure). The decode thread's `HandoffBlockSource` + the format layer's
`&mut dyn BlockRead` surface (§3.3) make motion methods **absent by type**
— v0.1's "compile-time removal" claim is now actually true, because the
narrow trait exists rather than pretending required trait members away.
Ranged reads do their SPACE (filemarks + blocks) before the window opens,
on the actor thread, as today.

### 5.5 Ranged reads — same transport, proof-frontier release (verify major: mechanized)

v0.1 left `read_plaintext_file_range` as a second, synchronous consumer with
**no integrity check at all** (no hash; only the 1 GiB arithmetic tripwire
bounds how far an undetected position error could stream) — and read-ahead
would have *widened* that window to reservoir scale. v0.2 unified the
transport but specified a release bound the delivered types could not
implement: `ReadBufferHandoff` discards
`ReadBatchOutcome::position_evidence` (model.rs:522), so the decoder had no
way to know where the proven cursor was, and the withheld bytes were
neither stored nor charged anywhere. v0.3 mechanizes it end to end. The
owner position stands: this is integrity-first — ranged reads get the FULL
mechanism, no exemption.

- **Transport unified (held from v0.2):** ranged reads ride the same
  submitter/reservoir/decode/sender pipeline (`HandoffBlockSource` + range
  framing in the decode layer). The one-path claim is true again; the
  second synchronous consumer is deleted.
- **Proof frontier, carried in-band, from exactly two sources:** data
  deliveries are `SequencedHandoff`s (§3.2) — strictly monotonic `seq`,
  `plan_records_end`, preserved `PositionAfter` evidence; standalone RPs
  arrive as `ProofFrontier` messages naming the exact `through_seq` /
  cursor they prove. The decode thread maintains **`proven_frontier`** =
  the greatest proven `plan_records_end`, advanced **in seq order** by
  (a) a handoff whose evidence is `Device(DevicePositionProof)` — the
  funnel's periodic inline **tripwire RP**, proving through THAT command
  (cadence clamped to 256 MiB in hash-less windows, below), and (b) a
  `ProofFrontier` message — the window-open RP, the **mandatory §4.3
  park-resume RP**, or the on-demand RP below — proving through the LAST
  COMPLETED command it names (never the next; §3.2). A passing device
  proof through command N proves every earlier in-order handoff too: the
  frontier jumps to N.
- **Release rule (hash-less windows):** bytes are released to the sender
  only up to `proven_frontier`. Handoffs beyond it are **withheld**,
  in seq order, in a bounded pending-proof queue on the decode side.
- **Withheld bytes are stored IN the reservoir and charged AS the
  reservoir:** pending-proof handoffs hold reservoir slabs that are, by
  definition, filled-and-not-yet-consumed — they stay inside the
  reservoir's §4.6 reservation (no second allocation, no separate budget)
  and **count toward watermark occupancy**, so a lagging frontier
  throttles the submitter through the ordinary gate. Bound: withheld
  bytes ≤ effective proof cadence + one handoff, and the cadence is
  CLAMPED to `min(position_check_bytes_ranged,
  effective_reservoir_bytes / 2)` (default 256 MiB — vs the 1 GiB
  tripwire, a 4× tighter unproven window at noise-level RP cost) so
  withholding can never consume the whole reservoir.
- **Proof-on-demand — no park deadlock, by construction:** if withheld
  bytes exist and the submitter is about to park (or is gated while the
  frontier trails the read cursor and no data READ is issuable), the
  submitter issues a standalone READ POSITION before parking. A passing
  proof covers everything issued so far ⇒ frontier = read cursor ⇒ the
  withheld queue drains. Without this rule, a reservoir full of unproven
  handoffs would park the submitter and no future proof could ever
  arrive — a deadlock the v0.2 text silently permitted.
- **Proof failure with buffered output (test row, §10):** RP mismatch ⇒
  `mark_position_unknown()` + poison, and every withheld handoff is
  DISCARDED — never delivered. That is the entire point of withholding:
  bytes already released were covered by an earlier passing proof; bytes
  in doubt die in the reservoir.
- **Full-object reads:** exempt from the release rule — their end-to-end
  manifest hash (§3.4) catches wrong-position data with certainty at
  delivery. The same `ReadDelivery` protocol flows (ONE delivery protocol
  for full-object and ranged windows alike); the decode layer simply does
  not apply the bound.
- **Upgrade path, named:** if/when the RAO format grows per-chunk digests,
  the decode layer verifies ranges directly and the release bound retires.
  Format question, tracked in §12, not R2 scope.

### 5.6 Error precedence across three threads (verify major: mechanism replaced)

Without a rule, a submitter-side SCSI error surfaces to the client as a
derived "channel closed" from whichever thread noticed last — gutting
attributability. v0.2 stated the right precedence but proposed a once-cell
— first-writer-wins, which CANNOT enforce a priority order (a sender
failure that fills the cell beats the later-arriving SCSI root). v0.3:

- The delivery channel carries `Result<ReadDelivery, TapeIoError>`
  (§3.2); the submitter's classified root error travels **in-band, exactly
  once**.
- **Precedence: P0 submitter-classified funnel/SCSI root > P1
  decode-derived (validation / format / frontier) > P2 sender/transport**
  — and a genuine client disconnect (h2/TCP-proven, §4.5) is a separate
  short-circuit CAUSE, not a rank (there is no client to attribute to).
- **Mechanism: a REPLACEABLE priority-ranked terminal accumulator** — a
  shared slot where a write replaces the held cause iff strictly
  higher-priority; equal/lower-priority late arrivals are dropped (first
  of a rank wins within the rank). Deliberate stop-on-consumer-death is
  NOT a cause: the submitter records P0 only for classified funnel
  errors; noticing a dead consumer records nothing (otherwise a sender
  death would launder itself into a submitter-rank cause).
- **Finalization barrier — no terminal status until no higher-priority
  cause can still arrive:** producers follow a **record-then-close
  discipline** — each thread records its terminal cause into the
  accumulator BEFORE closing/dropping its downstream channel. Channel
  closes propagate submitter → decode → sender, so when a downstream
  stage sees close, every upstream cause is already recorded. The window
  teardown then **joins all three threads — the joins ARE the barrier
  proof — and emits the terminal gRPC status exactly once** from the
  accumulator. No thread fabricates a terminal status from its local
  view; nothing is emitted while any upstream producer is live.
- **Panics: post-join ranked-cause translation (mechanism CHOSEN, v0.4 —
  over per-stage `catch_unwind`, which would force sender-ownership
  contortions to keep channel-drop ordering intact).** A panicking stage
  records nothing itself; its unwind drops its channel endpoints, so the
  §3.2 close propagation and drop order hold unaided. At the barrier,
  a `JoinHandle` that returns a panic is translated into a cause at that
  stage's rank (decode panic ⇒ P1, sender panic ⇒ P2) and offered to the
  accumulator under the same replace-iff-strictly-higher rule — a
  recorded P0 SCSI root still wins over any panic translation.
- **Disconnect short-circuit:** on proven client death the full teardown
  still runs (poison, drain, joins, pool accounting) but status emission
  is skipped — no peer. Asserted in tests alongside the race rows (§10):
  submitter SCSI error racing a decode panic racing a sender stall ⇒ the
  client status carries the SCSI root **even when it is recorded last**.

## 6. The 13.28 MB/s pathology — hypothesis ladder (R1 LANDED)

The 82→13.28 gap was ~6×; no submission-gap model explains it. Ranked
hypotheses, updated for R1 (main@5740f1a):

| # | Hypothesis | Status post-R1 |
|---|---|---|
| **H1** | **`ChannelWriter`'s 10 ms sleep-quantized retry** — 64 KiB chunks against a 16-deep channel locks the writer to 1–2 chunks per 10 ms ⇒ 6.5–13 MB/s, bracketing the field number | **FIX LANDED** (watchdog `send_with_timeout`, no poll quantum) + `sender_stall_ms` observable. Mechanism-confirmed; field confirmation = leg 0 |
| **H2** | h2 flow-control window at default 65,535 B — ~13 MB/s at ~5 ms RTT independently | **FIX LANDED** (explicit 4 MiB stream + connection windows). Client side must match — cross-repo deliverable, §11 |
| **H3** | 64 KiB default chunk size — per-message `to_vec`, wakeups, framing ×16/MiB | **FIX LANDED** (256 KiB default; channel sized by 4 MiB byte budget) |
| **H4** | depth-2 rendezvous `sync_channel` between produce and sender | Addressed in R2 (§3.3 byte-sized decode→sender channel) |
| **H5** | SHA-256 without HW acceleration | Dev box confirmed `sha_ni` 2026-07-11; DL385 one-liner at leg 0 (§3.3) |
| **H6** | client-side write path (remfield-io buffering/fsync, client disk) | `client_write_rate` diag already landed (TIO-5b) isolates it |

H1+H2 compounding explains the field number; leg 0 (§10) re-runs the July
restore on main+R1 and pins the decomposed baseline the submitter is judged
against — the design still refuses to let read-ahead take credit for, or
blame from, a plumbing bug.

### 6.4 R1 record (LANDED main@5740f1a) and residuals

Shipped: watchdog-bounded `blocking_send` preserving per-chunk
deadline/error semantics (`send_with_timeout`, receiver-drop watchdog on an
OS thread — the panel's naive-`blocking_send` trap was avoided; diff-gated),
256 KiB default chunk, channel capacity from a 4 MiB byte budget
(`read_stream_channel_capacity`), explicit 4 MiB h2 stream+connection
windows, `sender_stall_ms` diag. **Dropped from v0.1's R1 list, per panel
(negative value):** item 4, zero-copy refcounted slices from
`StagedReadWriter` — sharing ring memory into the network path pins
reservoir buffers behind a slow client and re-couples exactly what the
reservoir decouples; the copy-out stays. Residuals: (a) the 30 s per-chunk
deadline is re-scoped by §4.5 when R2 lands (diagnostic tick + h2
keepalive, abort only on proven death); (b) client-side window/chunk
matching is a **sutra-agent deliverable** (§11); (c) field confirmation is
leg 0.

## 7. Throughput model (honest)

### 7.1 Anchors (all measured on this hardware)

| Anchor | Number | Source |
|---|---|---|
| st/dd read, same drive+HBA+cart | 246–293 MB/s | 07-08 morning battery |
| HH LTO-9 native ceiling | ~300 MB/s | drive spec (FH 400 does not apply) |
| Write submitter, 1 MiB grant, pre-TIO-5 cadence | 157–164 MiB/s @ 6.2–7.2 ms/cmd | 07-07b window |
| Wire+kernel cost, 1 MiB command | ~0.85–1 ms | dd vs cadence decomposition |
| July read, CLI-ish plumbing (pre-batch, ~256 KiB/cmd) | 82 MB/s | July window — consistent with sync ping-pong at ~3 ms/cmd |
| Field daemon restore | 13.28 MB/s | 07-07b — the §6 pathology, fix landed (R1) |

### 7.2 Chain budget at 300 MB/s target

| Link | Estimated capacity | Basis / caveat |
|---|---|---|
| Submitter feed (ioctl + ε gap) | ~700+ MB/s | write-side symmetric arithmetic; **read ioctl cadence never yet measured physically — the single biggest model uncertainty (§1.2); leg 0/1 measures it** |
| Tape/drive | ~300 MB/s | drive-limited by design (2×+ headroom above it) |
| Decode thread (copy-out + parse + SHA-256) | ~600 MB/s–1.5 GB/s | dev box `sha_ni` CONFIRMED; DL385 EPYC architecturally has it, one-line confirm at leg 0; 4 KiB-block tapes multiply per-record overhead ×64 — see below |
| Sender + tonic (R1 landed) | target ≥ 500 MB/s | leg 0 measures; the known pathology mechanisms are fixed |
| Network | localhost/10GbE ≥ 1 GB/s; **1GbE ≈ 110 MB/s** | deployment fact; 1GbE restores are network-bound — the reservoir (§4) turns that into parked batching, not shoe-shine |
| Client disk | tmpfs/NVMe ≥ 1 GB/s; SATA root ≈ 220 MB/s | TIO-4 measurement lineage |

**4 KiB-block geometry (panel, sharpened):** per-record fixed costs ×64 is a
property of the TAPE (AOX034 is initialized at 4 KiB), penalizing **every**
restore from that cartridge, not just small objects. Modeled ≈7.5% of a core
at 300 MB/s — likely fine, but it is a model. **Pre-freeze micro-bench**
(copy-out + parse loop at 4 KiB records, hermetic); records-coalesced
copy-out (memcpy whole handoff, parse in place) folds into R2 **iff the
bench shows it binding** (v0.1 Q6 answered).

**Multi-object reality (panel, convergent):** the table above is a
single-object transfer budget. Production clip-pull restores interleave
per-object positioning (SPACE/LOCATE + spawn/join) with transfer;
positioning amortization is a named follow-up arc (§3.5), and the
acceptance suite gains a multi-object leg (§10 leg 4) so the shipped claim
covers the real workload shape.

### 7.3 Estimates (min of chain, per deployment)

- **Server-local restore to tmpfs/NVMe:** 250–300 MB/s — drive-limited.
  Acceptance gate: **300 MB/s is the target (owner decision, §11); the gate
  is mechanism-proven** — sustained rate ≥ drive-limited ceiling minus
  measured overheads, `feed_gap_us` p95 ≤ 500 µs, `free_wait_us` ≈ 0 — per
  TIO-5 §8 discipline (prove the mechanism, then read the number the drive
  allows).
- **LAN 10GbE client, fast disk:** ≈ the same, minus relay tax — expect
  230–280 MB/s; honest unknown until leg 0 decomposes R1 in the field.
- **1GbE client:** ~105–110 MB/s, network-bound. **Deployment note, not a
  defect and not a reason to skip R2 (owner):** the drive-side behavior is
  now §4's — clean bounded park/resume batching, never continuous
  shoe-shine (the "never" holds by construction: reposition count is
  bounded by the §4.1 arithmetic, no detection or control law involved).
- **What this design does NOT claim:** that 300 MB/s end-to-end is reachable
  on any path whose slowest link is below 300; that the 13.28 number is
  explained until leg 0 measures the landed R1 in the field; that
  4 KiB-block objects reach the same rate as 256 KiB ones (micro-bench,
  above); that read cadence equals write cadence (leg 0/1).

## 8. Instrumentation

Extends TIO-5b's read diag (already per-command `gap_us`/`ioctl_us` in the
funnel, restore_total decomposition line) — full spec in §3.6; summary:

- Submitter: `free_wait_us`, `park_us`, derived `feed_gap_us` (= gap −
  deliberate waits; the acceptance signal), window intent marker at window
  open. **Per-command audit events retained; no coalescing (§3.6).**
- Reservoir: live occupancy gauge, withheld-pending-proof gauge (§5.5),
  park/resume cycle counter, effective reservoir bytes + clamp reason at
  window open.
- Decode: busy vs recv-wait. Sender: busy vs stall (`sender_stall_ms`,
  landed) — now a re-arming diagnostic tick, not a kill (§4.5).
- restore_total: `bottleneck=` (max busy fraction); `relay_ms` becomes
  sender-busy; exclusive-subtraction relay estimate dropped.
- Cross-thread counters: atomics or post-join snapshot (§3.6).
- **Drishti/viveka slow-I/O signal — DUAL-SIDED (owner decision):** emit a
  "drive below streaming rate / reposition-rate" signal for **both** restore
  (read: park/resume cycle rate + live park counter — the pipeline's own
  counters; no LOG SENSE reposition counter exists on this stack) **and**
  ingest (write:
  feed-rate below streaming band on the write submitter's existing diag).
  This is the "unmonitored slow share quietly wears the drive" guard — the
  alert, wired into the viveka policy config, is what turns a chronically
  slow deployment from silent wear into an ops ticket. The **write-side
  big-buffer analog** (sizing the append spool so slow ingest sources batch
  cleanly instead of dribbling) is a noted symmetric FOLLOW-UP — not R2
  scope, recorded here so it isn't lost.

## 9. Invariants and crash rows

1. **Exactly one SCSI data command in flight, ever** — model transport
   asserts no overlapping execute across the three-thread scope; the drive
   handle is reachable from exactly one thread by construction (§3.1/§3.3).
2. **Golden-fixture regression with ZERO designed deltas — precondition
   named (panel m5):** the READ CDB sequence (counts, order, trailing
   partial batch, tripwire RP cadence, timeout classes) for a canonical
   **all-GOOD, full-batch** restore is captured from main (post-TIO-5b +
   §4.4 hardening) and must be **byte-identical** under the pipeline. The
   byte-identical claim holds only on the all-GOOD path — residual/
   recovered/filemark outcomes make subsequent counts runtime-derived by
   design; those paths are covered by the §5.2 assertions instead
   (`requested ≤ submitter_remaining`), not by fixture identity.
3. **One funnel per direction:** every READ goes through `read_block_batch`
   via `read_buffer_handoff`; no parallel decode, no submitter-side sense
   interpretation, **no audit-motivated fork (§3.6)**. Read-hardening
   commits (§4.4) modify the one read funnel for all read callers; the
   write side has TWO entry points and gets the enumerated shared helper
   (§4.4), never a shared-funnel claim. (Codex additive-bias rule: wrap,
   don't copy — this is the single-safety-funnel statement for the prompt
   set.)
4. **Typed-handoff exposure unchanged + tightened:** the only path from
   pool memory to consumer bytes is `ReadBufferHandoff` honoring
   `valid_bytes`, now cross-checked against `bytes_transferred` (§4.4);
   sentinel test re-run across multi-window reservoir-scale reuse.
5. **No CDB after invalidation:** after ILI/reset-UA/poison, zero data CDBs
   without explicit reposition + proof (funnel gate, asserted). After
   EVERY watermark park (regardless of duration) and after any incidental
   wait ≥ `T_REPROOF_INCIDENTAL`: no data CDB before a passing
   READ POSITION re-proof — proof-pass is a state-machine precondition,
   `GATED → RESUMING(rp-pending) → FILLING` (§4.3).
6. **No delivery past the proven frontier, for hash-less reads** (§5.5):
   ranged windows release bytes only ≤ `proven_frontier`, advanced solely
   by in-seq-order proof evidence — `Device`-evidence handoffs (inline
   tripwire RP) and `ProofFrontier` messages, each attached to the exact
   cursor it proves; withheld handoffs are reservoir-charged and are
   DISCARDED on proof failure.
7. **Plan-bounded motion:** total records issued == plan, asserted; no
   speculative record, ever.

Crash/kill rows (reads are non-mutating — the table is short and must stay
short):

| Kill point | Recovery rule |
|---|---|
| mid-ioctl READ | no data hazard; session lost; reopen distrusts position per readiness rules (unchanged) |
| after handoff push, before consumer drains | handoffs are process-local; nothing was promised to the client that gRPC didn't deliver; client sees stream reset |
| consumer dead, submitter mid-ioctl | submitter completes the in-flight command, push fails, stops; ≤ reservoir+1 over-read, all discarded |
| decode thread panic | scope unwinds per §3.2 drop order: delivery close → submitter stops → sender poisoned → client gets error status (precedence §5.6) |
| kill while drive PARKED (reservoir full, §4) | reservoir is process RAM (§4.7): all buffered records lost, zero data risk; drive was motionless; reopen re-proves position as always |
| kill during poison drain | free-channel buffers are process memory; pool accounting is process-local; nothing durable to reconcile |

## 10. Testing

Hermetic (model transport / chaos), symmetric to TIO-5 §9's write rows:

- one-in-flight assertion under read pipelining (three-thread scope);
- golden READ-CDB fixture, zero deltas on the all-GOOD path (§9.2),
  timeout classes recorded;
- **staged-intent cancel matrix** (§5.2): FILEMARK+residual, ILI after N /
  before any, reset-UA on READ and after a GOOD batch (incl. 29/07),
  recovered-full, recovered-with-VALID-residual (⇒ fail-closed, §4.4),
  deferred sense, transport error, tripwire mismatch, GOOD+tripwire-RP-fail
  — each asserting (a) no boundary-crossing or stale-count READ is issued
  (`requested ≤ submitter_remaining`, including all-GOOD tail batches),
  (b) handoff withheld/delivered exactly per the §5.1 table, (c) cursor/mode
  invalidation state matches TIO-5b's existing tests;
- **funnel hardening rows (§4.4):** `records_read × block_size >
  bytes_transferred` ⇒ completion-unknown, on filemark and recovered read
  paths; impossible-residual fail-closed; **write-helper rows:** enumerated
  call sites in `write_block_batch` (recovered-full, residual-partial) and
  `write_block_batch_pipelined` (recovered-full,
  `PartialBatchUncommittable` degrade-to-completion-unknown); **parity:**
  identical sense fixtures through both write entry points ⇒ identical
  helper decisions; EOM/EW device-position arbitration byte-identical
  (helper diag-only there); garbage-resid clamp-to-0 ⇒ completion-unknown;
  data-out resid-unreported ⇒ check passes vacuously (never spuriously
  fails);
- **error precedence rows (§5.6):** submitter SCSI error + racing decode
  panic + sender stall ⇒ client status carries the SCSI root cause **even
  when the SCSI root is recorded last** (accumulator replace rule beats
  arrival order); a panicked stage is translated post-join into its rank
  (decode ⇒ P1, sender ⇒ P2) and never outranks a recorded P0;
  record-then-close ordering asserted per thread; terminal
  status emitted exactly once, only after all three joins; genuine client
  disconnect ⇒ teardown runs, emission skipped;
- sentinel stale-tail across multi-window reservoir-scale reuse;
- consumer-death row: drop the delivery receiver mid-window ⇒ submitter
  issues no further READs (≤1 completes), poison protocol ordering
  asserted (close-before-join, §3.2 drop order), pool accounting balances;
  symmetric row for free-channel disconnect;
- **reservoir rows (§4):** park at high-water / resume at low-water;
  occupancy overshoot ≤ one command's bytes; **position re-proof rows:**
  EVERY park→resume — zero-duration included — requires a passing RP
  before the next READ (`GATED → RESUMING → FILLING` precondition
  asserted); **resume-RP attribution:** the resume RP's `ProofFrontier`
  names the LAST COMPLETED command's seq/cursor — a fixture crediting it
  to the next-issued command must FAIL (the §3.2 off-by-one row);
  incidental wait ≥ `T_REPROOF_INCIDENTAL` likewise re-proves; RP
  mismatch ⇒ poison; degenerate config rejection (`high ≤ low`, reservoir
  < minimum pool, spool budget > ceiling); **RAM reservation rows
  (§4.6):** Σ granted
  permits ≤ ceiling under a concurrent-growth RACE (two streams + spool
  against a near-exhausted ceiling); permit rollback on alloc/mlock
  failure; refuse-to-start on minimum-pool mlock failure (no swappable
  fallback exists); growth-step permit denial non-fatal (effective cap,
  warn once); slow-alive client parked indefinitely with NO abort;
  dead peer while parked ⇒ h2/receiver-drop teardown, drive never moves;
  **half-open-while-parked (no FIN):** keepalive PING tears down
  connection/stream/receiver/session within the §4.5 bound, poison drain
  runs, drive never moves; shared-ceiling contention (two streams, second
  clamps);
- slow-consumer row: throttled decode ⇒ submitter blocks/parks (never
  spins, never drops), `free_wait_us`/`park_us` recorded, `feed_gap_us`
  clean, all bytes exact;
- free-channel capacity ≥ pool / non-blocking return / construction
  assertion (`allocated == free headroom == delivery headroom`, §3.2);
- plan-bounded read-ahead: total records issued == plan exactly, for full
  object, ranged read (incl. first-block offset), and trailing partial
  batch;
- `HandoffBlockSource` validation parity: byte/record mismatch,
  filemark-early, zero-record outcomes reproduce today's `refill` errors
  byte-for-byte; decode-side `remaining` slaving (Σ received ≠ Σ issued at
  close ⇒ fail-closed);
- **ranged-read / proof-frontier rows (§5.5):** ranged restore rides the
  pipeline (one-path proof); frontier advances only on in-seq-order
  `Device` evidence; bytes past `proven_frontier` withheld until proof
  lands; withheld bytes counted as reservoir occupancy and gate the
  submitter; **proof-on-demand RP before park drains the withheld queue
  (no-deadlock row: reservoir full of unproven handoffs must not wedge)**;
  proof failure with buffered output ⇒ every withheld handoff discarded,
  never delivered; cadence clamp (≤ half effective reservoir) honored;
  full-object exemption (metadata flows, bound not applied);
- **4 KiB micro-bench (pre-freeze):** copy-out + parse at 4 KiB records;
  coalesced copy-out folds into R2 iff it binds;
- chaos kill rows per §9 table (incl. kill-while-parked);
- CLI path: file-writer consumer through the same core (one-path proof);
- Scenario: extend the restore scenario's `covers` with
  `rem.tape.read_pipeline`; full `~/system` suite green from clean slate.

Physical (next MSL3040 window), in order:

0. **Decompose-first (R1 field confirmation):** re-run the July 4 GiB
   restore on main@5740f1a (R1 landed) with TIO-5b diag BEFORE R2 is
   enabled — confirm H1/H2/H3 fixed in the field, pin the baseline R2 is
   judged against, measure read ioctl cadence (§1.2), run the DL385
   `sha_ni` one-liner (§3.3), and probe whether the E208e/mpt3sas path
   reports nonzero data-out resid on a forced partial (§4.4 write-helper
   scope: protective vs vacuous on this stack).
1. Daemon restore, server-local tmpfs sink: sustained rate at the
   drive-limited ceiling; `feed_gap_us` p95 ≤ 500 µs; `free_wait_us` ≈ 0
   (drive-limited proof). Target 300 MB/s (§11).
2. Chunk-size and h2-window sweep over one LAN client (H2/H3 residuals);
   requires the sutra-agent client-side matching (§11).
3. **Throttled-consumer soak:** cap the client at ~150 MB/s (the §4.1
   worst-case `c = d/2`), ~100 MB/s, and ~30 MB/s, ≥ 30 min each; clean
   park/resume cycles at the configured watermarks; reposition counts
   (library syslog) ≈ predicted cycles per the §4.1 arithmetic and
   **orders of magnitude below un-reservoired shoe-shine**; validate the
   ≤ 60 cycles/hr anti-wear arithmetic at the worst case and re-derive
   the §4.8 default if the drive-rate anchor moves; qualify the drive's
   minimum observed park latency (`T_REPROOF_INCIDENTAL` keep-or-drop,
   §4.3); park re-proof RPs visible in diag; Drishti signal fires.
4. **Multi-object restore leg (panel):** N-clip pull across the tape;
   measure per-object positioning share; this leg prices the §3.5
   follow-up arc with data.
5. Restore + append dual-drive concurrent leg (joins TIO-5 §8 leg 2 — the
   HBA-decision leg); shared RAM ceiling behavior observed (§4.6).
6. 4 KiB-block object restore (AOX034 is already initialized at 4 KiB) —
   per-record cost reality check against the pre-freeze micro-bench.

## 11. Config and rollout

Config: §4.8 (two existing keys, five new keys — the daemon
`io_memory_ceiling` plus four reservoir/proof keys — all documented in
`reference-configuration.md`, degenerate configs rejected at load), plus
the §4.5 keepalive transport defaults (server 30 s interval / 20 s
timeout; client 30 s / 20 s with `keep_alive_while_idle(true)`) recorded
in `reference-configuration.md` alongside the R1 h2 windows. **No mode
switches** (v0.7 one-path rule / NOT-in-production
policy): the pipelined read path is THE read path; backout is git revert +
previous binary; old behavior survives as the golden READ-CDB fixture and
the existing cross-version stored-image tests.

Stages (each independently landable, diff-gated, scenario-verified):

1. **R1 — relay fixes: LANDED** (main@5740f1a, 2026-07-11, diff-gated).
   Field confirmation = leg 0. R1 was also R2's *operational* prerequisite
   (panel): without it, R2 would have starved every restore at the relay
   and parked/shoe-shined the drive for nothing.
2. **R2 — read submitter + reservoir: GO, target 300 MB/s (owner
   decision).** The cost lens argued R2 should be conditional on leg-0
   measurement (R1+sync ceiling ≈ 210–250 might clear a 250 gate; 1GbE
   paths cap at 110 regardless). **Owner overruled: 250 is insufficient;
   the target is 300, and R2 proceeds regardless of leg-0's number.** The
   lens's 1GbE honesty is kept as a §7.3 deployment note, not a gate.
   Additionally, R2 now carries the anti-shoe-shine reservoir — a wear
   mechanism wanted independent of peak throughput — which moots
   gate-on-throughput on its own. Scope: §3 architecture (incl. retyped
   consumer), §4 reservoir (watermark stop-start), §4.4 funnel hardening
   (prerequisite commit), §5 state machine incl. ranged unification, §8
   diag, §10 hermetic rows. Prerequisite ordering within R2: funnel
   hardening → trait split (`BlockRead`) → submitter/reservoir → ranged
   unification.
3. **Cross-repo deliverable (owner decision): sutra-agent client-side
   matching.** The client must set matching h2 stream/connection windows
   and the 256 KiB chunk request on its channel, or H2 re-appears
   client-side on any non-local link. A sutra-agent prompt/design follows
   (that repo's docs/); if the flag surface spans repos, single-source it
   as a shared contract (`contract-read-stream-tuning.md`) per the
   referenced-contracts rule. Server-side values are already recorded in
   `reference-configuration.md` (R1).
4. **Drishti/viveka wiring (owner decision):** the dual-sided
   below-streaming-rate / reposition-rate signal (§8) lands with R2's diag
   and is registered in the viveka policy config. Write-side spool-sizing
   analog: follow-up, noted in §8.
5. Physical validation per §10; leg 3 validates the park-cycle arithmetic
   and re-derives the reservoir/watermark defaults if the measured
   drive-rate anchor moves; leg 4 prices the positioning-amortization arc.

## 12. Open questions — v0.1 answers recorded, v0.4 residuals

**Answered (owner, 2026-07-11):**

1. ~~Shoe-shine acceptance~~ — **REJECTED.** Anti-shoe-shine is core; the
   reservoir (§4) is the mechanism. The throughput lens's reframing (RAM
   buys reposition *frequency*, and the access pole makes slow restores
   common) stands vindicated in the owner's direction.
2. ~~SHA-256 placement~~ — **inline on the decode thread, confirmed**;
   verification is decode/format-layer property per §3.4; dev-box `sha_ni`
   confirmed, DL385 one-liner at leg 0.
3. ~~R2 gating~~ (was the cost lens's biggest ask) — **R2 is GO, target
   300 MB/s**, not gated on measurement (§11).
4. ~~Client-side flag ownership~~ — **sutra-agent deliverable**, prompt to
   follow (§11.3).
5. ~~Naming~~ — **TIO-6** (commits already use it).
6. ~~4 KiB coalesced copy-out~~ — **in R2 iff the pre-freeze micro-bench
   shows it binding** (§7.2, §10).

**Remaining open (tracked for the final verify / field legs):**

1. **Read ioctl cadence** (§1.2/§7.2): the model's biggest uncertainty;
   leg 0/1 measures. If materially worse than write cadence, §7 reflows —
   the design's *structure* is unaffected, its numbers are.
2. **Watermark defaults** (90/25 on the DERIVED 8 GiB default; 4 GiB
   labeled experimental minimum — §4.8): the derivation is only as good
   as its inputs (drive-rate anchor, ≤60 cycles/hr target); leg 3's
   park-cycle counts confirm or re-derive. Sizing guidance (bigger
   reservoir for slow-consumer deployments) is documentation, but whether
   the *default* should be larger on big-RAM hosts is a deployment
   judgment for after leg 3.
3. **Per-range digests in RAO** (§5.5): format-layer question — would
   retire the ranged proof-frontier release bound (§5.5). Owned by the RAO
   format thread, not R2.
4. **Sender-thread necessity post-R1/R2** (v0.1 Q4): keep the split (it
   isolates network stalls from hash/parse and now feeds the reservoir
   drain); with the decode→sender channel byte-sized (§3.3), measure, and
   simplify later if the sender is provably pass-through.
5. **Parked-session occupancy policy** (§4.5): park-and-wait is the v1
   rule (owner); if the field produces parked-forever sessions holding
   drive reservations, an idle policy is a *future* design with its own
   review — explicitly NOT designed now (NOT-in-production rule: no
   speculative eviction machinery).
6. **Positioning-amortization arc** (§3.5): leg 4 prices it; likely the
   next TIO thread after R2 for clip-pull workloads.
7. **Anti-wear target provenance** (§4.1): ≤ 60 cycles/hr is engineering
   judgment, stated as revisable; vendor mechanism-life data would firm
   it; leg 3 validates the arithmetic at the measured worst case.
8. **Data-out resid reporting on this stack** (§4.4): the leg-0 probe
   decides whether the write-side residual helper is protective or
   vacuous on E208e/mpt3sas (it is safe either way — one-sided check).
9. **Minimum park latency** (§4.3): can this drive stop/reposition inside
   250 ms? Leg 3 measures; decides whether `T_REPROOF_INCIDENTAL`
   survives or incidental waits go to conservative always-re-proof.
   (Watermark parks are already duration-independent — this residual
   touches only the incidental-wait heuristic.)
